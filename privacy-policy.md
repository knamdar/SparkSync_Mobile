# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-01-11

SparkSync is designed to run entirely on your device. This policy explains what data is
handled and how it is used.

## Information we collect
SparkSync does not collect, store, or transmit personal information to our servers.

## Data stored on your device
- Saved devices and custom actions are created by you and stored locally.
- Credentials are stored in the iOS Keychain.
- Deleting the app removes saved devices, custom actions, and credentials.

## Network connections
SparkSync connects only to the hosts you configure. Any data you send over SSH is sent
directly to those hosts. SparkSync does not operate its own servers for these
connections.

## Sharing and disclosure
We do not sell or share your data with third parties because we do not collect it.

## Children's privacy
SparkSync is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data
from children.

## Changes to this policy
If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted on this page with a new
effective date.
