# Media checklist

## Screenshot checklist
- Use a clean install with no real device names.
- Prefer consistent time, battery, and carrier indicators.
- Capture light and dark appearance if available.

## Video checklist
- Keep demos short and task-focused.
- Show the empty state, device add, connect, terminal, and custom action flow.
- Trim any pauses or sensitive data before sharing.

## Naming guidance
- Screenshots: device-home, device-settings, terminal, custom-actions.
- Videos: demo-overview, demo-terminal, demo-custom-actions.

Place screenshots in `assets/screenshots` and videos in `assets/videos`.
