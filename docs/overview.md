# Overview

SparkSync helps you connect to remote machines over SSH, work in a built-in terminal, and launch custom actions tied to each device. It is designed for quick access to the tasks you repeat most often, without bundling any sensitive data into the app.

## Who it is for
- Operators and engineers who need fast access to remote hosts.
- Anyone who wants a tidy, device-first view of their SSH connections.
- Teams that need a consistent, documented workflow for custom actions.

## Core workflow
1. Add a device with its connection details.
2. Connect and verify the session.
3. Use the terminal if needed.
4. Create custom actions for common tasks and URLs.

## Data handling principles
- Devices and customs are created by the user only.
- Passwords are stored in the device Keychain.
- No demo content is bundled with the app.
